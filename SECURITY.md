# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

Private vulnerability reporting has been enabled on this repo. If you would like to report a security vulnerability, please utilize github's built-in private vulnerability reporting. (https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

You can also reach out to the contributors at je2230@nyu.edu to report vulnerabilities. 

To report a vulnerability in a dependency this project relies on, you should report this directly to the maintainers of that module.
